🚀 About the Project

Smart Agriculture Assistant empowers farmers through AI-driven automation and IoT hardware integration, guiding them from the initial idea of farming to data-driven profit generation.
We combine AI models, IoT sensors, and Raspberry Pi-based hardware to make agriculture smarter, faster, and more sustainable.

Our hardware runs on a Raspberry Pi 4 equipped with a Pi Camera Module V2 and environmental sensors for real-time field monitoring.
The system analyzes conditions like soil moisture, humidity, and temperature, while CNN-based image processing detects crop health and diseases automatically.
